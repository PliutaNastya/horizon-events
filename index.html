					<h1 class="hero__title">The first written reference occurs in the eighth century, in one of the earliest Japanese texts.</h1>
					<div class="hero__text">
						<p>In the myth, a god named Izanagi travels to the netherworld to find his wife, Izanami. This was considered a taboo journey at the time.</p>
						<p>As Izanagi returned from his dangerous voyage, he took time to stop and bath, thereby purifying and transforming himself.</p>
						<p>As the centuries passed, these acts of purification and transformation became more adventurous, and thus, the practice of Misogi was born.</p>
						<p>Ascetic practitioners took an annual pilgrimage around the mountains of medieval Japan, challenging themselves in unique and uncommon ways.</p>

						<div class="live-forever__text text">
							<p>Perhaps it is easier to describe the opposite: mundane hours, days and weeks of routine, of life on “autopilot,” where the time disappears into blurred memories – in these cases, it is as though you have never really lived at all.</p>
							<p>Horizon Events is about consciously designing adventures, experiences, and memories to shake us up, to break the routine, to challenge us, and to answer the all-important question: when was the last time you tried something for the very first time?</p>

										<p>You won’t do all of them — but you’ll be pushed. This is designed to test you, not break you. You’ll be supported the whole way by elite instructors and a solid crew beside you - they know most of us are in our 40s.</p>
